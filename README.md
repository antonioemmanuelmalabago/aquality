## üìã Overview

Aquality is an IoT-based water quality monitoring and analysis system developed as a thesis project to address the challenges faced by the Rosario Water System, an LGU-operated utility serving over 11,000 households. The project tackled the specific problem of monitoring isolated cases of muddy water in their groundwater-sourced system through a comprehensive solution that combined IoT hardware prototypes installed in individual households, a web-based monitoring application, and a robust cloud database infrastructure. The system features real-time water quality data collection, SMS notifications for water quality alerts, and a reliable database mirroring technique between local SD card storage and cloud databases for data backup. Upon rigorous testing, the prototype demonstrated 90% accuracy compared to laboratory results, establishing itself as a cost-effective, reliable, and scalable solution for municipal water quality monitoring needs.

## üéØ Objectives

- Design a monitoring system that assesses water quality parameters (pH level, turbidity, total dissolved solids, pressure, and temperature).
- Assemble a hardware system comprising an array of water sensors, a robust microprocessor, and a wireless communication module.
- Include an intuitive interface for displaying the recorded sensor readings.
- Implement database mirroring technique between local SD card and Firebase RTDB.
- Perform calibration techniques to match the accuracy of laboratory results.
